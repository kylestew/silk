# CreativeSketchTemplate

A (hopefully) quicker way to stand up a Javascript creative coding environment focused on 3D realtime with Three.js.

## Organization

- All files meant to be customized are in `/src`
- `Main.js` is the app entry point and runs the app based on the `settings` exported from `src/sketch.js`
